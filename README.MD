* `Sudo-Ransome` is a Ransomware software that encrypts the files of a system and
decrypts only after a sum of money is paid to the attacker.
Encryption is the process of encoding information so only authorized parties can
access it.

* The tool uses `TCP(Transmisiion Control Protocol) Socket connection` to send ransome key and victim's information to attacker's server.

* Once rasnome code is installed on the target machine. it will try to connect to the host server based on the `server IP and Port`
